###Game Project###

-The goal of this project is to create a turn based RPG strategy game on an animated 8x8 isometric board where players can drop heroes (or tokens) and deploy them against the enemy.
-The objective is to clear the board of all enemies. 
-Still haven't decided if it'll be multiplayer or single player. if multiplayer, websockets will be utilized to connect the two players together where they both will drop tokens and
fight against each other.
